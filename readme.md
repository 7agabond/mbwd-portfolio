# [MattBaileyWEbDeveloper](www.mattbaileywebdeveloper.com)

source for my portfolio website. I use this site not only to showcase my work, but this is also where I get to learn new skills and put them to use. Right now I'm perfecting OO-JS. 

Built into the site is some functionality for which plugins already exist - like [JQuery Waypoints](https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints), but I wanted to implement it my own way and create some plugins of my own. Shortly I plan to extract them out and offer them as stand-alones.
